 * Load a Node built-in module. ID may or may not be prefixed by `node:` and

 * injected polyfills, and if we used dynamic require then in addition to bundlers logging warnings,
 * our code would not work when bundled to ESM and run in Node 18.
 * @param {string} id ID of the built-in to be loaded.
 * @returns {object|undefined} exports of the built-in. Undefined if the built-in
 * does not exist.
